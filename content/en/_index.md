    title: "<a id='appel-a-demonstrateurs'></a>Call for Demonstrators"
    subtitle: "Join NumPEx by submitting to the call for application demonstrators."
    
    text: |-
     One of the objectives of NumPEx is to encourage synergies between research groups and application domains.

     The strategy adopted is one of co-design of software solutions associated with algorithmic motifs of computation and communication, and their integration to accelerate the development of application demonstrators.
     
     NumPEx will coordinate and finance the co-design strategy, with the application demonstrators, by a compute and data team (CDT) at the interface between research and application groups. An application demonstrator will be the result of a conjoint effort of the NumPEx teams and the application development teams.
      
      Applications can be submitted by filling in the [“Application Demonstrator” form](/AplicationDemonstrators-AD-form.docx) and sending them to

      We will have a large number of openings, starting from September 2023, with the possibility of earlier dates. Each Target Project will publish calls for candidates.
      - ExaMA
      - ExaSoft
      - ExaDoST
      - ExaAToW
      - ExaDIP: 

        - we are seeking 5 candidates for our Compute and Data Team (CDT)
        - the positions are for 2 to 5 years, with remuneration as a function of experience
        - location: Paris, Bordeaux, Grenoble
        - the profiles we seek begin from Postdoc level (directly after a PhD), and extend to candidates with 3 to 5 years experience after their PhD
        - the positions involve working on co-design projects, combining upstream research performed in NumPEx's other target projects, with application development teams (see the call for Application Demonstrators above)
